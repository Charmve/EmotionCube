# -Intelligent-speech-companion-robot-based-on-sentiment-analysis-

Taking emotion analysis and intelligent speech as the research object, in order to improve the current situation of intelligent furniture robot <b>lack of emotional interaction</b>, an intelligent companion robot is designed based on <b>expression recognition</b> and <b>intelligent speech</b>. The system mainly includes an expression recognition camera, an intelligent voice module, and a full color light cube display system. After actual testing, the system has fast response, high recognition accuracy, stable work, and a good experience, making people's lives more intelligent and user-friendly.

## Oritation/Application
Function positioning of companion robot:
- <b>Home entertainment</b> The smart speakers equipped with technology terminals such as voice recognition and microphone make the companion robot more humane and improve the happiness of life;
- <b>Popular science education</b> The full-color light cube animation stimulates children's imagination of three-dimensional space, their interest in intelligent technology, and spreads knowledge of three-dimensional modeling;
- <b>Emotional complement</b>
According to the results of sentiment analysis, Light Cube uses different melody music and animations to express their feelings
Love makes interaction more lively and interesting and heals emotions.

## Insights


## How's it going?

<b>1. Dynamic expression recognition</b>

To put it simply, facial expressions are part of the human body's (physical) language, which is a physical and psychological response, usually used to convey emotions. There are many kinds of human facial expressions. At present, the recognition of the six basic human expressions of happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust and fear is relatively good. Facial expressions can be recognized better, and signs and commands are given to control people. The machine interactive device completes the corresponding action. Due to the complexity of human emotions, these expressions are not enough to fully determine the emotional fluctuations in a person's heart. To improve the accuracy of judgment, it is necessary to pass comprehensive evaluations such as heart rate detection and voice processing.
